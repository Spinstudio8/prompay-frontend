        <h4 className="font-bold">Biology and Characteristics of life</h4>
        The word biology means,"the science of life",from the Greek bios, life
        ,and logos, word or knowledge. Therefore, Biology is the science of
        Living Things.That is why Biology is sometimes known as Life Science.
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          • Living things are composed of matter structured in an orderly way
          where simple molecules are ordered together into much larger macro
          molecules. An easy way to remember this is GRIMNERDC Allorganisms;- G
          row, R espire, I nteract, M ove, Need Nu trients, E xcrete(Waste),R
          eproduce, D eath, C ells(Madeof).
        </p>
        <p>
          • Internal functions are coordinated and regulated so that the
          internal environment of a living thing is relatively constant,referred
          to as homeostasis 10 .
        </p>
        Living things are organized in the microscopic level from atoms upto
        cells .Atoms are arranged into molecules,then into macromolecules ,which
        makeup organelles which work together to form cells.
        <br />
        Beyond this,cells are organized in higher levels to form entire
        multicellular organisms. Cells together form tissues, which makeup
        organs,which are part of organ systems, which work together to form an
        entire organism. Of course, beyond this organisms form populations which
        make up parts of an ecosystem. All of the Earth's ecosystems together
        form the diverse environment that is the earth.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4 className="font-bold">Cells</h4>
        The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "smallroom",and
        it was ﬁrst coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork.The
        cell is the basic unit of all living things,and all organisms are
        composed of one or more cells.
        <br />
        Cells are so basic and critical to the study of life,infact that they
        are often referred to as "the building blocks of life".
        Organisms-bacteria, amoebae and yeasts for example-may consist of as few
        as one cell, while a typical human body contains about a trillioncells.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4 className="font-bold">Structure of Eukaryotic Cells</h4>
        Eukaryotic cells feature membrane delimited nucleii containing two or
        more linear chromosomes; numerous membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles
        mitochondria, lysosomes, vacuoles, chloroplasts; ribosomes and a
        cytoskeleton. Also plants, fungi, and some protists have a cell wall.
        <br />
        The nucleolus appears in a microscope as a small dark area within the
        nucleus. The nucleolus is the area where there is a high amount of DNA
        transcription taking place.
        <br />
        <h4 className="font-bold">Vertebrate Digestive System.</h4>
        Functions to break down food into molecules small enough to absorb, or
        pass across digestive membrane.
        <br />
        Digestive tract: tube extending from lips of mouth to anus or cloacae in
        bird, reptile or monotreme.
        <p>
          Lumanal glands: empty into inner body cavity (lumen: inner surface).
        </p>
        <p>
          Tract divided into three main regions: 1. buccal cavity 2. pharynx 3.
          alimentary canal
        </p>
        <p>
          Alimentary canal divided into four regions: 1. esophagus 2. stomach 3.
          small intestine 4. large intestine
        </p>
        <p>
          Accessory digestive glands, outside digestive tract proper, secrete
          into lumen of tract through ducts. Includes the salivary glands, liver
          and pancreas. Buccal cavity, which includes palate and tongue,
          develops from infolding of stomadeum, or second opening of blastula,
          whereas the rest of the digestive tract develops from the primitive
          gut.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teeth: capture and hold prey. In mammals in particular further process
          and break down food into small particles, increasing surface area
          available for enzymatic action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tooth anatomy: 1. crown projects above gum, 2. root below gum, 3.
          enamel is outer coating of crown, hardest surface in body, of epideral
          origin 4. dentin, below enamel, bone-like and forms bulk of tooth, is
          harder than bone and contains nerves and blood vessels. (Remember that
          mammals are heterodontic, with different types of teeth).
        </p>
        <p>
          Pharynx: air passage for adult, gill slits in embryo. Important in
          lower vertebrates, site of gills. Features derived from pharyngeal
          region: first pharyngeal pouch gives rise to parts of the ear, other
          pouches give rise to various other structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alimentary canal: epithelium lines lumen, glands secrete into lumen,
          longitudinal and circular muscles help digestive movements
          (peristalsis).
        </p>
        <p>
          Esophagus: tube carries food from mouth to stomach. Expands to fit
          large bolus (lump of chewed food). Secretes mucus for lubrication.
          Birds have crop for storage, enlargement of esophagus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Epiglottis: keeps food out of air tube, an evolutionary “kludge,” or
          fix. Stomach. Absorbs water, alcohol, nutrients, uses gastric juice
          with enzymes, mucous, HCl, released by chief and parietal cells
          (release protein enzymes) in gastric pits. Rugae: folds of stomach,
          disappear when full. Sphincter at both ends of stomach, control food
          passage. Small intestine: three regions, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
          Duodenum site of most intestinal digestion. Jejunum and ileum do most
          of intestinal absorption. Ileum ends with another sphincter, ileocolic
          valve or ileosecal valve. Structure: Circular folds covered with villi
          (singular is villus).
        </p>
        <p>
          Villi: finger-like cellular projections, covered with microvilli, tiny
          projections which increase surface area. Increases surface area by
          900x, speeds digestion (break down) and absorption (taking in
          nutrients).
        </p>
        <p>
          Large intestine: larger diameter, shorter length than small intestine.
          No villi. In mammals, forms large gentle loop, colon, empties into
          straight region, rectum, empties into outside world through anal
          sphincter. Colon: absorbs water left over, also absorbs vitamins
          released by bacteria which live there (vitamin K).
        </p>
        <p>
          Food: made up of 1. proteins, 2. fats, 3. carbohydrates 4. fibrous
          material. Digestive system breaks foods down. Proteins must be broken
          to amino acids to be absorbed. Polysaccharides to monosaccharides,
          lipids to fatty acids and monoglyc#erides to absorb. Salivary glands
          in mouth, saliva contains mucous, salt and a few enzymes (amalase,
          begins starch breakdown). Snake venom from oral gland, mixture of
          toxins and digestive enzymes. Breaks down blood vessels and disables
          nervous system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stomach enzymes: released in inactive form, zymogene, converts to
          active form in lumen of gut. Transformation is triggered by another
          enzyme, or the stomach’s low pH. Pepsin secreted as pepsinogen (-ogen
          means primitive form). Stomach glands secrete up to two or three
          liters a day of gastric juice, which is reabsorbed. Chyme released to
          duodenum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small intestine has two major accessory glands: 1. pancreas 2. liver
          Pancreas has endocrine and exocrine functions, releases large amounts
          of carbonate to neutralize acidic chyme, as intestinal enzymes work in
          neutral pH, and stuff to break down lipids and starch (zymogens, like
          tripsin) Liver releases bile. Bile made from cholesterol, stored in
          gall bladder, released in duodenum, emulsifies fats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emulsify: keeps fats in tiny drops, which are suspended, increasing
          surface area and action of lipases. Protein and carbohydrates absorbed
          in intestine, taken to liver for processing. Fatty acids go to
          lymphatic system
        </p>
        <p>
          Appendix: vestigial remnant. Much variation in digestive systems
          within mammals: herbivore, carnivore, insectivore, non-ruminant
          herbivore.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Rumen: four-chambered stomach of animals like cows (ruminant
          herbivores). Cellulose resistant to digestion, rely on microorganisms
          to break down cellulose. Some bacteria, protists and fungi can break
          down cellulose, almost no animals can. Bacteria break down cellulose
          in rumen, to be taken back to the mouth to chew their cud (ruminate).
          Later cow swallows to proceed with digestion.
        </p>
        <h4 className="font-bold">Tissue and systems</h4>
        <p>Epithelial tissue</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Comes from various sources, ectodermal or endodermal material. Cell
          sheet lines a surface or body cavity. One side, called freesurface or
          Apical, is exposed to
        </p>
        • animal interior (forming the lumen) or
        <br />
        • exterior of its body cavity.
        <br />
        The other side rests on the basal layer.
        <br />
        Epithelial tissue is not penetrated by blood vessels.
        <br />
        Two categories:
        <br />
        • sheets
        <br />• glands
        <p>
          Classifified on two features:
          <br />
          • simple, (a single layer of cells),
          <br />• stratifified, (more than one cell layer.)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Cell shape at free surface:
          <br />• squamous (broad and flflat) • cuboidal (spherish) • columnar
          (tall and thin)
        </p>
        <p>
          Simple squamous epithelium
          <br />
          usually lines body cavities and vessels,alveoli, glomeruli of kidney;
          in blood and lymph vessels called endothelium; in body cavities called
          mesothelium (serosae): parietal serous membranes line body wall,
          visceral serous membranes cover organ
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Simple cuboidal epithelium
          <br />
          in ducts like kidney and salivary glands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simple columnar epithelium
          <br />
          nonciliated type lines digestive tract, ciliated type lines some
          regions of uterine tubes and lungs
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Stratifified squamous epithelium
          <br />
          (important) lines mouth, esophagus,and vagina. Cells sometimes dead,
          flflat and keratinized, making them resistant to abrasion.
          Stratifified squamous epithelium changes to columnar squamous
          epithelium progressively down esophagus to the stomach.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Epidermis
          <br />
          137Epithelial tissue from epithelium. Below this is dermis, thicker
          and with blood vessels.
          <br />
          Two specialized epithelia:
          <br />
          • pseudostratifified
          <br />
          • transitional
          <br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Pseudostratifified epithelia
          <br />
          lines the trachea (where it is ciliated)and the male urethra (where it
          is non ciliated), looks stratifified but not.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Transitional epithelia
          <br />
          found only in bladder and urinary system. As it stretches it appears
          to go from 6 to 3 cell layers deep.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Glandular epithelia <br />
          gland: group of cells that excretes something.. mostly derived from
          epithelium. Glands are classifified into endocrine and exocrine by
          where they excrete.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Endocrine glands: secrete hormones into the blood without use of
          ducts.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Exocrine glands: secrete onto the body surface or into a cavity, thru
          a duct. Exocrine substances include sweat, mucous, oil, and saliva. An
          exocrine gland is the liver, which secretes bile.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Connective tissue</h4>
        <p>
          This is a “grab bag” category of diverse tissue types. Functions
          include binding and supporting. Types include bone, cartilage,
          fifibrous connective tissue, blood and adipose (fat) tissue.
          <br />
          If you took away everything in the body except the connective tissue,
          you’d still be able to see the basic form of the body.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Form: distinctive cells surrounded by a cell matrix made of
          extra-cellular fifiber grounded in a ground substance (excluding
          blood)
          <br />
          Types:
          <br />
          1. connectile connective tissues (can be 1. loose or 2. dense)
          <br />
          2. special connective tissue (includes blood, bones and cartilage).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Fibroblasts form connective tissue proper;
          <br />
          chondoroblasts form cartilage;
          <br />
          osteoblasts form bone; and blood is formed from various sources.
          <br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ground substance: “unstructured” material that fifills space between
          cells and contains fifibers. Made of
        </p>
        <p>
          1. interstitial flfluid (bathes cells)
          <br />
          2. proteoglycans (protein core with attached polysaccharides,
          glycoaminoglycans or GAGs such as chondroitin sulfate, keratin
          sulfate, and hyalronic acid, whose consistency is syrupy to
          gelatin-like)
          <br />
          3. cell-adhesion proteins (connect connective tissue cells to the
          fifibers).
